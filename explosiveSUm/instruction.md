# Explosive Sum - codewars

## How many ways can you make the sum of a number?

From wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)

_" In number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive integer n, also called an integer partition, is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers. Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same partition. If order matters, the sum becomes a composition. For example, 4 can be partitioned in five distinct ways: "_

You should be able to call `defaultArguments` repeatedly to change the defaults.

```bash
4
3 + 1
2 + 2
2 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1
```

### Examples

```bash
sum(50) // 204226
sum(80) // 15796476
sum(100) // 190569292
```
